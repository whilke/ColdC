Instructions for Win32 Genesis BorlandC 5.01 Compile, by Jon Lambert

1. Untar files on a Unix box.

2. Change to Genesis-x.xpxx directory

3. Run 'configure', say NO to malloc replacement and file restrictions.

4. Switch to src directory

5. Run 'make Win32', the following files should be created:

      src/grammer.c
      include/config.h
      include/parse.h
      modules/moddef.h

   Look at the SIZEOF values in include/config.h and verify they are
   correct for your compiler (SIZEOF_LLONG and LLDOUBLE may differ).

6. Zip or tar/gzip resulting source tree, move to Win32 system, unarchive.
   tar/gzip by changing to be outside the Genesis-x.xpxx directory, then do:

      tar -cf Genesis.tar Genesis-x.xpxx
      gzip -9 Genesis.tar

7. Get a port of GDBM/NDBM.  There are several DOS ports on the net.
   The source code I found was rather hacked but compiled without errors
   to a static lib file.  Although there were no errors, make sure all
   integers and longs are defined to 32-bits instead of DOS's 16-bits.
   This is especially critical in the hashing algorithms.  A copy of
   GDBM for Win32 (not necessarily up to date) can be found at:

       ftp://ftp.cold.org/cold/contrib/gdbm173s.zip

8. Copy the NDBM.H header into your Genesis include directory and your LIB file
   into the Genesis src directory. (I called it WINGDBM.LIB in my makefile)

9. Copy src/Makefile.borland to src/Makefile, edit for your system
   This make links everything static and has debugging options on.
   Make it anyway you prefer.  

10. Finally run Borland's make against it.

11. With a little luck, it should run.  If you have any questions, feel free
