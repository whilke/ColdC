## and depth of the FIFO list defined by you.

# Setup:
# Create a directory called "dbbin" off of your would directory. Put this
# script in the directory and make it executable. Add the file
# "timestamps" to the "logs" directory. Put four "0" (zeros) in the file,
# one per line.
#
# check the following variables and make sure they are appropriate to
# your system.

# simply update the most recent backup, they will not shift the list
