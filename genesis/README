GENESIS

Genesis is the compiler and run-time interpreter/daemon for ColdC, and
is produced by the Cold Project.  You can learn more about helping to
support the Cold Project at:

    http://web.cold.org/

Release information can be found in doc/CHANGES.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN UNIX

Genesis should compile on most ANSI/ISO C compilers.  If your compiler
is somewhat non-standard, Genesis may compile but you will have serious
instability problems.  The only OS which we know you WILL have problems
with is SunOS 4.1.x (which is dead and no longer supported by Sun--we
suggest NetBSD as an alternative).

To compile simply type: make

To install simply type: make install

The directory 'bin' contains a few useful scripts for Genesis database
manipulation.  Full installation instructions can be found at:

      http://web.cold.org/genesis/install.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL/COMPILATION IN WIN32

You will need an ndbm implementation in Win32.  You can get GNU's ndbm
implementation (gdbm) to cover this role.  You must first have access
to a unix system, with either bison or yacc.  Read doc/Win32-INSTALL
for full instructions.

A copy of GDBM for Win32 can be found at:

      ftp://ftp.cold.org/cold/contrib/gdbm173s.zip

It is suggested that you try to find more current versions before using
this copy.
